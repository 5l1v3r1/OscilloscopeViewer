# Oscilloscope Viewer
Qt based cross platform viewer of Tektronix CSV files
(C) 2019 Collin Kidder

A Qt5 based cross platform tool which can be used to load Tektronix CSV files from
an oscilloscope and visualize it. Allows fast scrolling, zooming including
zooming into one axis at a time.

Not particularly full featured at the moment but can load millions of samples
and visualize them real pretty like.
